#Experiments with GraalVM

* My Second repository in Git Hub,

* First Use of Nashron direct calling and with Bindings and context.

* Passing JSON Object from Java to JS and vice-versa(JsonTest.java and ReturnTask.java).

* Calculated the time for calling a programm from only java and from both Java and JS with GraalVM seperatley for 1000 times and took average of it and the same procedure is repeated for 5 times and took the final averageof it and calculated the time difference between them,which resulted a difference of "0.54"Milli seconds(TimeCalculation.Java and TimeCalulationwithonlyJava).
